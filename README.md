# OpenGL bonsai generator 

A 3D bonsai tree generation algorithm built on top of a primitive OpenGL graphics engine. Bonsai growth is  randomly generated and animated for fun. 

There are two viewing modes: `USER` where the camera is operated by the user and `ROTATING` where the camera follows a preset path.

## About
`Bonsai` is a project that comprises of two parts: a recursive bonsai generation algortihm and an OpenGL graphics engine.  
<br>

#### 1. Recursive 3D bonsai generation algorithm
Surprisingly, this was the most straight-forward part of the project. Essentially, each branch is slowly generated through a recursive function tracked by a diminishing growth rate. To increase the realism of the trees, each branch was also segmented into tiers, with the highest tier being the main trunk. As a branch's tier decreases - the probability of the tree branching also increases so as to imitate a real tree and create a more convincing transition into the foliage. 

#### 2. OpenGL graphics engine
Instead of a using a pre-built library to render the model generated by the above algorithm, I ultimately decided to build my own model viewer using OpenGL. While still basic, this part of the program features a shading system utilizing vertex and frament shaders only, a primitive lighting system and user-controlled camera movement.
