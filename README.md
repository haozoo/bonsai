# OpenGL bonsai generator 

A 3D bonsai tree generation algorithm built on top of a primitive OpenGL graphics engine. Bonsai growth is  randomly generated and animated for fun. 

There are two viewing modes: `USER` where the camera is operated by the user and `ROTATING` where the camera follows a preset path.
